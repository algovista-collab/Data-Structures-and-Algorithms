## Encode N-ary Tree to Binary Tree: TC - O(n), SC - O(n)
- https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-n-ary-tree-to-binary-tree/description/
- Encode: keep a queue to store pairs of Binary node and N-ary node
- Create a new binary root from N-ary root and push both to the queue
- run a while loop until queue is empty, keep head and prev TreeNode pointers
- run a for loop over N-ary node and create a new TreeNode for every child
- if prev != nullptr, prev->right = bChild else head = bChild
- push both N-ary child and bChild to queue and after for loop, set bNode->left = head
- Decode: keep a queue to store pairs of N-ary node and Binary node
- Create a new N-ary root from binary root by passing vector<Node*> {} for children, push both to the queue
- run a while loop until queue is empty, set sibling = bNode->left
- run a inner while loop over sibling->right, create new N-ary child every loop and push it to children
- push both to the queue and finally return newRoot
