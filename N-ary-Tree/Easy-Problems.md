## Traversal
- **Preorder**: We start with the root node, go to its children until leaf node, then go to the other children
- Inorder traversal does not make sense in N-ary tree
- **Postorder**: We go to the leaf node of one child, then traverse back to root and so on
- **Level**: Similar to Binary Tree
